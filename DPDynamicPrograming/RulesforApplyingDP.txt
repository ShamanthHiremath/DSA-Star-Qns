RULES FOR APPLYING DP

1)When multiple possible ways/ counting the number of ways possible to do a problem is asked
2)Which is the MAX of all or MIN of all ways
3)Try all possible cases RECURSIONS
4)Perform all ways and sum it

1)Try to represnt the prob in INDEXES
2)Device the Algorithm to find the possible way for that output
3)Sum of all possible ways (if MIN or MAX is asked, take MIN or MAX and add)
