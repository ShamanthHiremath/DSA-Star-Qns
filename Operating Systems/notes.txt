What you need?

// a condition variable that is used to block a thread until it is notified
std::condition_variable cv;

// a mutex that is used to protect the shared resource (the turn variable)
std::mutex m;

// puts a lock on the mutex and waits for the condition variable to be notified
std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(m);

// a boolean variable that indicates whether the game is over or not
int turn = 0; // 0 for P1, 1 for P2



What do the funtions do?

// this function makes the current thread wait for the condition variable to be notified, while getting or freeing the lock on the current mutex
cv.wait();

// wakes up all threads that are waiting on the condition variable
cv.notify_all();
